# CS210_Fall23_Term_Project

My project is aiming to give some valuable information about my listening habits and taste of songs while searching for a question that I have in my mind. This question is about the genres of musics that I put in my playlists. Also, I have got a playlist called 'Various' and it contains 389 songs from different artist, languages, etc. Additionally, I used this playlist as my project material because the importance of data has been significantly getting important and becoming widespread, especially after the pandemics. That is why I collected my data from a Spotify analyzer by scraping it. Also, I collected more general data about my account by requesting it from Spotify. Shortly, I used them in order to test my hypothesis, and see the shape of my data. I used different tecniques such as exploratory data analysis, various data visualization, and machine learning algorithms. In addition to this, I tested my null hypothesis by determining the p-value and comparing it with the significance level, so that I can whether reject it or not. I found out that my data is rational since I could be able to find the correct answer about rejecting or failing to reject my hypothesis correlating with my data. Additionally, I was shocked about the deviation, diversity, and number of types of genres. Other than that, I am quite happy with the results because of the fact that I see have a taste of music related to my moods. The distibution of my data is suitable for data projects since it does not depend on stereotypes.
As I stated before, the data that I received from Spotify has no information about genre of a song. So I used beautifulSoup, but I used that Spotify data tooas an extra study on my project.
