# CS210_Fall23_Term_Project

My project is aiming to give some valuable information about my listening habits and taste of songs while searching for a question that I have in my mind. This question is about the genres of musics that I put in my playlists. Also, I have got a playlist called 'Various' and it contains 389 songs from different artist, languages, etc. Additionally, I used this playlist as my project material because the importance of data has been significantly getting important and becoming widespread, especially after the pandemics. In order to see the shape and test my hypothesis, I used it.
